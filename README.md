## Hi, I'm Atique 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Calgary with experience building full-stack applications, data pipelines, and real-time systems.

I enjoy working on projects that involve:
- Backend and full-stack web development
- Data engineering and analytics
- Real-time data processing and system reliability
- Applied software used by real users

### Featured Projects
- **Real-Time Data Tracking & Analytics System**  
  Streaming data pipeline built with Apache Kafka and PostgreSQL for real-time analytics and monitoring.

- **Full-Stack Web Applications**  
  React-based applications focused on structured data workflows and user-centric design.

- **Embedded & Sensor-Based Systems**  
  Arduino-based projects translating physical sensor data into reliable software inputs.

I'm always interested in learning new tools, improving system reliability, and building practical software solutions.
