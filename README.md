## Hi, I'm Atique

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Calgary focused on data engineering and analytics, with experience building full-stack applications and real-time systems.

I enjoy working on projects that involve designing reliable data pipelines, processing streaming data, and building software that is used by real users.

### Tech Focus
- Data engineering & analytics (Apache Kafka, SQL, PostgreSQL)
- Real-time data processing and system reliability
- Backend and full-stack web development (Python, JavaScript, React)
- Embedded and sensor-based data collection (Arduino)

### Featured Projects
- **Real-Time Data Tracking & Analytics System**  
  Streaming data pipeline built with Apache Kafka and PostgreSQL for real-time analytics, validation, and monitoring.

- **Full-Stack Web Applications**  
  React-based applications focused on structured data workflows, usability, and maintainable frontend architecture.

- **Embedded & Sensor-Based Systems**  
  Arduino-based projects translating physical sensor input into reliable, low-latency software signals.

I'm always interested in learning new tools, improving system reliability, and building practical software solutions at the intersection of data and systems.
